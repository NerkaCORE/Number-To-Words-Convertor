# Number To Words Convertor

Some algo function I coded in PHP to convert a number under 1.000.000.000 to letters in french.

I made it during a project with a company who needed to generate fiscal attestations which requires also the number in letters.

You are free to use this code as you want and adapt it for english words which is pretty simple.
